The Project is not completed. Updated Path Finder is not working properly in some cases (In Dev-2 branch). Some systems may or be broken. The game is lacking game loop.

I simply made the repository public to show it on my portfolio. I decided not to develop the game anymore since it would take me too much time to complete.

For Developers who wants to learn some complex systems I think this is a good half baked project. Please check Dev-2 branch to see the latest updates.
